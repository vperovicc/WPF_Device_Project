This project, titled (Content Management System), is a Windows desktop application developed using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). The primary goal of this application is to provide users with a convenient and intuitive platform for managing various types of content, such as devices, within an organization or personal environment.

Key Features:

**Rich Text Editing:** The application includes a RichTextBox component that allows users to edit content with formatting options such as font styles, colors, and sizes.

**Content Storage:** Device information and content are stored persistently using XML files. Each device is associated with an RTF (Rich Text Format) file for storing detailed information.

**Toolbar Functionality:** A toolbar provides users with convenient tools for formatting text in the RichTextBox, including options for bold, italic, underline, font family, and font size.

**Visual Customization:** The application features customizable visual elements, such as row backgrounds and font styles in the DataGrid, to enhance the user experience.

**User Interaction:** Users can interact with the application through mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and button actions, ensuring smooth navigation and operation.

**Error Handling:** The application includes error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages to users.
